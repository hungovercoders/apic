# CLI reference

```
apic [command] [flags]
```

Each command's section below explains what it does, its JSON and its
exit codes; [Commands and flags](#commands-and-flags) at the end is every
flag of every command, generated from the binary's own command tree.

All commands are non-interactive: apic never prompts. The one exception is
`apic ui`, the terminal UI, which refuses to start unless it has a terminal
to draw on. Colour is off when stdout is not a terminal, when `NO_COLOR` is
set, when `--no-color` is given, or when `--json` is used.

## Global flags

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-C, --dir <path>` | Project root holding the `.http` files and env files. Default `.`. Relative `.http` paths on the command line are resolved against it. |
| `-e, --env <name>` | Environment from `http-client.env.json`. Defaults to `env:` in `apic.yaml`, else none (only `$shared` values apply). An unknown name is an error listing the known ones. |
| `--var name=value` | Override a variable. Repeatable. Highest precedence. |
| `--json` | Machine-readable output. See each command for the shape. |
| `--no-color` | Disable colour. |
| `--no-session` | Do not read or write `.apic/session.json`; with cookies on, the jar stays in memory for the one command. |
| `--cookies` | Keep a cookie jar: cookies a response sets are sent with later requests to the same site and stored per environment in `.apic/cookies.json`. Same as `cookies: true` in `apic.yaml`. See [format.md](format.md#cookies). |
| `--timeout <duration>` | Request timeout, e.g. `10s`. Default 30s or `timeout:` in `apic.yaml`. `# @timeout` on a request wins. |
| `--insecure` | Skip TLS certificate verification. Reported as `tls.insecure` in `--json` and by `describe`. |
| `--cacert <pem>` | Trust the certificates in this PEM file in addition to the system roots, for an API behind a private CA. |
| `--proxy <url>` | Send every request through this proxy: an `http`, `https`, `socks5` or `socks5h` URL, or a bare `host:port` for HTTP. Beats `proxy:` in `apic.yaml` and `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`. Credentials go in the URL's userinfo and are shown as `***` wherever the proxy is reported. |
| `--no-proxy` | Send every request directly, ignoring `--proxy`, `apic.yaml` and the environment. |
| `--cert <pem>`, `--key <pem>` | Present a client certificate (mTLS); the key defaults to the `--cert` file. These override `tls:` in `apic.yaml` and the env files' `SSLConfiguration`. See [auth.md](auth.md#tls-and-client-certificates). |
| `--redact` | Mask values on both sides of the exchange in `run` output: every request header value, the request body, query-string values, captured values, the response body, every response header value, and the `actual`/`expected` of every assertion. Status, timing, size and pass/fail survive, so a stored CI log still says what failed. Sensitive request headers (`Authorization`, `Cookie`, API-key headers, and any header whose value came from a secret source) and sensitive response headers (`Set-Cookie`, `WWW-Authenticate`) are masked even without it. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | Success. For `run`, every assertion and capture passed. For `validate`, no errors. |
| 1 | `run`: at least one assertion or capture failed. |
| 2 | Usage error: unknown command or request, parse error in a `.http` file, unknown environment, missing variable, bad `--var`. `validate` with errors. |
| 3 | Transport error: DNS, connection refused, TLS failure, timeout. |

Errors are printed to stderr prefixed with `error:`; stdout stays clean for
piping. Every error has a stable code, and on a terminal a second line gives
it and where the [error catalogue](errors.md) explains it:

```text
error: me.http:1: missing variable
  {{token}}: pass --var token=... or add it to http-client.env.json
  E101 missing variable · see https://hungovercoders.github.io/apic/errors/#e101
```

Under `--json` the error is instead one JSON object on stderr, so a script
branches on `error.code` rather than the wording:

```json
{"error":{"code":"E101","title":"missing variable","message":"me.http:1: missing variable\n  {{token}}: …","hint":"Pass it with --var name=value, …","exit":2,"url":"https://hungovercoders.github.io/apic/errors/#e101"}}
```

A `run` result for a request that could not be sent carries the same object
as `error`, beside the `errors` list of messages. The exit status follows
from the code: E1xx and E2xx exit 2, E3xx exit 3.

## Request targets

Several commands take a target:

| Target | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `get-user` | The request with `# @name get-user`. An error if the name is used in more than one file. |
| `users.http` | Every request in the file, in order. |
| `users.http#get-user` | A named request in a specific file. |
| `users.http#3` | The third request in the file. Unnamed requests are listed with this id. |

Files are found by walking the project root for `*.http` and `*.rest`,
skipping hidden directories, `node_modules` and `vendor`. `apic.yaml` can
narrow this with `dir: api`.

## apic run

```
apic run <target>... [-v] [--body-only] [--keep-going] [--retry "<n> [interval]"] [--no-retry] [--output <file>] [--report <file.html>] [--data rows.csv|rows.json|- [--data-share-session]] [--assert <expr>]... [--capture <name=selector>]... [--dry-run]
```

Sends requests and reports status, timing, body, captures and assertions.
Several targets run in the order given. More than one request is a flow:
it stops at the first failed assertion, failed capture or transport error
unless `--keep-going` is set, and prints a pass/fail summary.

Captured values are available to later requests in the same run, and are
saved to `.apic/session.json` for the current environment (unless
`--no-session` or the request has `# @no-session`). A request with
`# @ref login` runs `login` first when a value it needs is missing, and one
with `# @forceRef login` runs it first every time; see
[format.md](format.md#dependencies). The terminal output shows the
dependency's report first, under `↳ ran login first (# @ref)`.

A request with `# @retry 10 2s` is sent again until its assertions pass,
up to ten times, two seconds apart; see [format.md](format.md#retries).
Each failed attempt prints `attempt 1/10 · <first failed assertion>` as it
happens, and the report of the attempt that counted ends its status line
with `· 3 attempts`. Results print as each request finishes, so a flow
shows progress.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-v, --verbose` | Show request headers and body, response headers, and where the time went: `dns 12 ms · connect 18 ms · tls 41 ms · ttfb 60 ms · total 87 ms · new connection`. |
| `--body-only` | Print only the response body, pretty-printed when JSON. For piping. |
| `--keep-going` | In a flow, continue after a failure. |
| `--retry "<n> [interval]"` | Retry policy for requests without `# @retry`: attempts and the wait between them (default `1s`). Overrides `retry:` in `apic.yaml`. |
| `--report <file.html>` | Also write a self-contained HTML report of the run: summary, every request with its status, timing, assertions (actual against expected), captures and the request and response headers and bodies, collapsed. Honours `--redact` like the text output and shows a "redacted" badge; sensitive headers are masked either way. Refused when the path is a project file. |
| `--no-retry` | Send every request once, ignoring `# @retry`, `--retry` and `apic.yaml`. |
| `--output <file>` | Save the response body to this file, relative to the working directory, overwriting: what a `>>! file` line in the request does (see [format.md](format.md#saving-a-response)). One request only; a flow is refused, and so is a project input as the target. The text output says `↳ saved to <file>` and `--json` carries `saved_to`. |
| `--data <file>` | Run the targets once per row: a CSV file whose header row names the variables, or a JSON array of objects; `-` reads stdin. See [Data-driven runs](#data-driven-runs). |
| `--data-share-session` | With `--data`, let one iteration's captures reach the next and the session file. |
| `--assert <expr>` | Check the response with an expression, as `# @assert` would, for this run only; repeatable. The result lists it after the request's own assertions, and a failure exits 1 like any other. A bad expression is a flag error before anything is sent. Try a check here before writing it into the file. |
| `--capture <name=selector>` | Capture a value, as `# @capture` would, for this run only; repeatable. It goes into the result and the session like a directive's capture. |
| `--dry-run` | Resolve each target and print the request that would be sent (method, URL, headers and body, with `-v`'s detail) without sending it: no dependency runs, no auth is applied, nothing is captured. A missing variable is the same error a run gives. `--json` prints the run object with `"dry_run": true` and no `response`. Refused with `--data`, `--output` and `--report`. |

Examples:

```sh
apic run login
apic run get-user --env staging --var userId=42
apic run auth.http users.http --json
apic run get-user --body-only | jq .email
```

`--json` prints one object per request (NDJSON for flows):

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "request": {
    "name": "get-user", "file": "users.http", "line": 10,
    "method": "GET", "url": "https://dev.example.com/users/42",
    "headers": {"Accept": "application/json", "Authorization": "Bearer eyJ..."},
    "body": "",
    "auth": "aws"
  },
  "response": {
    "status": 200, "status_text": "OK",
    "headers": {"content-type": "application/json"},
    "body": {"id": 42, "email": "alice@example.com"},
    "duration_ms": 87, "size": 412, "proto": "HTTP/2.0",
    "timings": {"dns_ms": 12, "connect_ms": 18, "tls_ms": 41, "ttfb_ms": 60, "total_ms": 87, "reused": false}
  },
  "captures": {"email": "alice@example.com"},
  "asserts": [
    {"expr": "status == 200", "pass": true, "actual": "200", "expected": "200"},
    {"expr": "body.$.id == 42", "pass": true, "actual": "42", "expected": "42"}
  ]
}
```

- `request.auth` names the auth type applied, when any; credentials apic adds are never included.
- `request.headers` are the headers written in the file, with sensitive values shown as `***` (see `--redact` above). URL, body and captures are shown in full unless `--redact` is set.
- `request.body` of a [multipart upload](format.md#multipart-uploads) is the summary `<multipart: 2 parts, 1 file>` rather than the assembled bytes.
- `response.body` is parsed JSON when the body is JSON, otherwise a string. A body that is not text (not valid UTF-8) is its base64 with `"body_encoding": "base64"` beside it, so a download survives `--json` intact. Under `--redact` it is the string `"***"`.
- `response.proto` is the protocol the response came over, `HTTP/1.1` or
  `HTTP/2.0`. `request.http_version` (omitted otherwise) is the version the
  request line pins, `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2`; see
  [HTTP version](format.md#http-version).
- `saved_to` (omitted otherwise) is where a `>> file` line or `--output` wrote the body, relative to the project root when inside it.
- `response.headers` keys are lower-case; multiple values are joined with `, `. `set-cookie` and `www-authenticate` are always `***`; under `--redact` every value is.
- `asserts[].actual` and `asserts[].expected` are `***` under `--redact`, and `expr` keeps only its selector and operator. `pass` and `error` are unaffected.
- `errors` (omitted when empty) lists failed captures and other problems.
- `warnings` (omitted when empty) lists problems that did not fail the
  request, such as a [response history](#apic-history) that could not be
  written.
- `ok` is false when any assertion or capture failed, and when a request a
  `# @ref` ran first failed; `errors` then names it (`@ref login failed`).
- `response.timings` breaks `duration_ms` down: name resolution, the TCP
  connection, the TLS handshake, the wait for the first byte of the
  response, and the total including the body, with `reused` true when
  the connection came from an earlier request of the same invocation (a
  flow's requests share their connections). A reused connection has no
  DNS, connect or TLS time; redirects and a digest challenge add their
  hops together. `duration_ms` is unchanged.
- `attempts` (omitted when no retry policy applied) is how many times the
  request was sent; the object describes the last attempt. Attempt lines
  are not printed under `--json`.
- `iteration` (only under [`--data`](#data-driven-runs)) is
  `{"index": 3, "total": 50, "row": {"id": "7"}}`: which row the object
  belongs to and the variables it supplied, values `***` under `--redact`.
- `skipped` (omitted otherwise) is `"disabled"` for a
  [`# @disabled`](format.md#pauses-and-disabled-requests) request that a
  file's flow did not send: `ok` is true and there is no `response`.
  Naming the request sends it.
- Requests a `# @ref` or `# @forceRef` ran first are printed as objects of
  their own, before the request that needed them, so there is still exactly
  one object per request sent. The `ran_first` key is only present in the
  MCP `run_request` result, where the dependency's result nests under the
  request's.
- When a request could not be sent at all (missing variable, network), the
  error goes to stderr and the exit code is 2 or 3; in a flow, the earlier
  results are still printed.

### Data-driven runs

```sh
apic run get-user --data users.csv
apic run checkout.http --data orders.json --keep-going --report orders.html
jq -c '[.[] | {id}]' ids.json | apic run get-user --data -
```

`--data` runs the targets once per row. In a CSV file the header row names
the variables (a spreadsheet's byte order mark is ignored); in JSON each
object is a row, numbers written without an exponent. The row's values
sit at `--var` precedence, over the same names from `--var`, for that
iteration only.

Each iteration starts from the session as it was when the run began and
writes nothing back, so what one iteration captures does not reach the
next: fifty users each get their own `{{id}}`, not the last one's.
`--data-share-session` runs every iteration on one session instead, which
also saves captures to `.apic/session.json` as a plain run does. A token a
`# @ref login` fetched is fetched once per iteration without it and once
with it.

The text output heads each iteration `iteration 3/50 · id=7 name=alice`
(the values left out under `--redact`) and ends with
`50 of 50 iterations: 49 passed`; each `--json` object carries
`iteration`. A failed iteration stops the run unless `--keep-going`, which
then runs every row and, as in a flow, every request; the exit code is 1
if any iteration failed. `--output` is refused with `--data`, since it
would be overwritten each time; `--report` covers every iteration.

## apic test

```
apic test [path|file.feature]... [--format f] [--output file] [--tags expr] [--stop-on-failure] [--use-session] [--steps]
```

Runs Gherkin feature files against the project's requests with a built-in
step vocabulary and the `# @step` phrases declared on requests. Default
path is `features/` under the project root, or `test.paths` in `apic.yaml`.
Each scenario gets an isolated in-memory session. See [testing.md](testing.md)
for the vocabulary.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-f, --format` | `pretty` (default), `progress`, `cucumber`, `junit`. `--json` selects `cucumber`. |
| `-o, --output <file>` | Write the report to a file. |
| `-t, --tags <expr>` | Tag expression, e.g. `"@smoke && ~@slow"`. |
| `--stop-on-failure` | Stop after the first failed scenario; the remaining scenarios are reported as skipped. |
| `--use-session` | Share `.apic/session.json` instead of isolating each scenario. |
| `--steps` | Print the vocabulary and this project's phrases (`--json` for machine form) and exit. |

Exit codes: `0` all passed · `1` failures or undefined steps · `2` no
features, a feature path outside the project, unknown environment, unknown
request, missing variable, bad phrase or bad flag · `3` a server could not
be reached. Feature paths must lie inside the project root.

## apic ui

```
apic ui [--demo]
```

Opens the [terminal UI](tui.md): requests on the left, each row carrying its
status and round trip once it has run, and preview, response, checks and
session tabs on the right. <kbd>enter</kbd> runs the selected request,
<kbd>f</kbd> runs its file as a flow, <kbd>e</kbd> switches environment,
<kbd>J</kbd>/<kbd>K</kbd> scroll the right pane, <kbd>?</kbd> lists every key.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--demo` | Serve the bundled fake API in-process and open the UI on its example project. Needs no project and no network. |

It is the only interactive command, and the only one without `--json`: with
`--json`, or when stdout is not a terminal, it exits 2 and points at
`apic run` and `apic list` instead. All the other global flags (`-C`,
`--env`, `--var`, `--redact`, `--timeout`, `--insecure`, `--no-session`)
work as usual.

## apic list

```
apic list [pattern]
```

Every request in the project in file order: id, method, URL template,
`file:line` and description, grouped by file. A pattern keeps only the
requests whose id, URL, file or description contains it, case-insensitively.

`--json`:

```json
{
  "root": "/abs/path/api",
  "requests": [
    {"id": "login", "name": "login", "method": "POST", "url": "{{baseUrl}}/auth/login",
     "file": "auth.http", "line": 6, "description": "Log in and keep the token",
     "captures": ["token"], "asserts": 1}
  ]
}
```

`name` is omitted for unnamed requests; `id` is then `file.http#N`. `steps`
lists the request's `# @step` phrases and `refs` its `# @ref` and
`# @forceRef` targets, when it has any. `disabled` is true for a request
marked [`# @disabled`](format.md#pauses-and-disabled-requests), which a
flow skips. A pattern filters the `requests` array; the shape does not
change.

## apic describe

```
apic describe <target>
```

Shows one request's method, URL template, headers, body, every variable it
references with the source it resolved from, its captures and asserts, and
whether it is ready to run. Missing variables come first, with the request
that captures them if there is one. A missing variable that a `# @ref` of
the request supplies does not make it unready: the line says the request
runs first.

`--json`:

```json
{
  "name": "whoami", "id": "whoami", "file": "auth.http", "line": 16,
  "description": "Uses the token captured by login",
  "method": "GET", "url_template": "{{baseUrl}}/bearer", "url": "https://httpbin.org/bearer",
  "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer {{token}}"},
  "variables": [
    {"name": "token", "source": "missing", "missing": true, "captured_by": "login", "ref_runs": true},
    {"name": "baseUrl", "value": "https://httpbin.org", "source": "http-client.env.json [dev]"}
  ],
  "captures": ["email = body.$.email"],
  "asserts": ["status == 200", "body.$.authenticated == true"],
  "refs": ["login"],
  "auth": "bearer {{token}}",
  "auth_source": "apic.yaml",
  "ready": true
}
```

`auth` and `auth_source` are present when a `# @auth` directive or
`auth.default` applies; see [auth.md](auth.md). `proxy` is present when a
proxy is configured by flag, `apic.yaml` or the environment:
`{"url": "http://***@proxy.internal:3128", "source": "apic.yaml"}`, or
`{"off": true, "source": "noProxy"}` for a host that bypasses it (the
source is `--no-proxy`, `--proxy`, `apic.yaml`, the environment variable's
name, or `noProxy`). The same object appears as `request.proxy` in
`run --json` and as `proxy` in `env --json`, and `run -v` prints it under
the request headers. `refs` lists the request's
`# @ref` and `# @forceRef` targets, and a missing variable has
`"ref_runs": true` when one of them captures it, so `ready` stays true.

Sources are one of `--var`, `shell APIC_VAR_<name>`, `captured this run`,
`session`, `http-client.private.env.json [env]`, `http-client.env.json [env]`,
`.env`, `<file>:<line> @<name>`, `built-in`, `response reference (flow only)`
or `missing`. Values with `"secret": true` (private env file, `.env`,
session) are shown as `***`.

## apic env

```
apic env
```

Environments found, which env files exist, the current environment,
every variable in effect with its source, and the JetBrains
[`Security.Auth`](auth.md#jetbrains-projects) configurations with the
oauth2 spec each maps to. Secrets are masked.

`--json`:

```json
{
  "root": "/abs/path/api",
  "environments": ["dev", "staging"],
  "current": "dev",
  "files": ["http-client.env.json", "http-client.private.env.json", ".env"],
  "variables": [
    {"name": "baseUrl", "value": "https://dev.example.com", "source": "http-client.env.json [dev]"},
    {"name": "password", "value": "***", "source": "http-client.private.env.json [dev]", "secret": true}
  ],
  "auth": [
    {"name": "my-api", "spec": "oauth2 clientId={{clientId}} clientSecret=*** grant=client_credentials tokenUrl=https://login.example.com/oauth2/token",
     "files": ["http-client.env.json", "http-client.private.env.json"]}
  ]
}
```

`auth` is omitted when the env files declare no configurations. An entry
apic cannot use has `error` instead of `spec`; `ignored` lists fields it
does not act on.

## apic session

```
apic session
apic session clear [--all]
```

`session` prints captured values per environment from `.apic/session.json`
(in clear text, since this is the one place you may need to see them).
Tokens cached by `# @auth oauth2` and `# @auth exec ttl=` appear as
`$oauth2:<hash>` and `$exec:<hash>` entries with their remaining lifetime.
Cookies kept by the [cookie jar](format.md#cookies) are listed under the
same environment with their name, scope and expiry, values masked.
`clear` forgets the current environment's values and cookies, or every
environment's with `--all`.

`--json` on `session` prints the raw map `{"<env>": {"<name>": "<value>"}}`;
cookies are not in it. `session cookies` lists the jar on its own, and with
`--json` prints `{"<env>": [{"name", "domain", "path", "expires", "secure",
"http_only"}]}`, never the values.

## apic history

```
apic history [request] [--show N] [-v]
apic history diff <request> [from] [to]
apic history clear <request> | --all [--every-env]
```

Response history is off until `apic.yaml` sets `history: N`. Then every
`apic run`, the UI and MCP's `run_request` and `run_file` keep the last
`N` responses of each named request, per environment, in
`.apic/history/<env>/<request>/`. Unnamed requests, `--no-session` runs,
`apic run --data` and `apic test` record nothing. A request that `# @ref`
ran first gets its own entry. A name two files both use is kept apart as
`file.http#name`, the target that picks either one. Each entry is the
result as `apic run --json` prints it, `saved_to` from `--output`
included, so sensitive headers are masked and a `--redact` run stores the
redacted form. A history that cannot be written (a read-only checkout, a
full disk) does not fail the run: the result carries a `warnings` entry
instead. See [Security](https://github.com/hungovercoders/apic/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
for what that leaves on disk.

`history <request>` lists the entries newest first, numbered from 1, with
the time, status, duration and size. With no request it lists the
requests that have history in the environment. `--show N` prints entry N
as `apic run` printed it (`-v` adds the headers). A request that has
since been renamed or deleted keeps its history and can still be read and
cleared by its old name. A request named `diff` or `clear` is reached as
`apic history file.http#diff`, since the bare word is the subcommand.

`history diff` compares two entries, by default `2` (the one before) with
`1` (the latest): first the status, then the body. A JSON body is compared
by structure, with keys in sorted order and arrays index by index, and
each change is a JSONPath of the kind `# @assert` reads. A text body is
compared line by line. Headers are left out, since a `Date` or a request
id differs every time:

```text
$ apic history diff list-todos
list-todos #2 (2026-10-06 10:00:01, 200) → #1 (2026-10-06 10:05:03, 200)
~ $[0].done: false → true
+ $[2]: {"done":false,"id":"3","title":"Write docs"}
2 changes
```

`history clear <request>` forgets one request's history in the current
environment, `history clear --all` every request's in the environment,
and `--every-env` every request's in every environment. A bare `history
clear` is refused rather than taken to mean the whole environment.

With `--json`:

| Command | Prints |
|---|---|
| `history` | `{"env", "keep", "requests": [{"request", "entries"}]}` |
| `history <request>` | `{"env", "request", "keep", "entries": [{"index", "time", "ok", "status", "status_text", "duration_ms", "size", "file"}]}` |
| `history <request> --show N` | the entry's fields and `"result"`, the stored `apic run --json` object |
| `history diff` | `{"env", "request", "from", "to", "changes": [{"path", "op", "from", "to"}]}`; `op` is `added`, `removed` or `changed`, and `from` and `to` are JSON values |
| `history clear` | `{"cleared": "<env>" or "*", "request", "entries"}` |

## apic curl

```
apic curl <target>
```

Prints a POSIX-shell `curl` command with every variable resolved, one flag
per line. Auth is mapped onto curl's `--user` and `--aws-sigv4` flags where
possible (see [auth.md](auth.md)). Fails with exit code 2 and the usual hint if a variable is
missing. Useful for a machine without apic, for a bug report, or for
pasting into a Taskfile.

```sh
apic curl create-user --env staging
apic curl get-user | sh
```

`--json` wraps it as `{"id": "get-user", "command": "curl -sS ..."}`.

With `--redact` the command is safe to paste into a stored log but no longer
runnable as printed: header values, the body and query-string values are
masked, and `bearer`/`basic` credentials become `$TOKEN` and
`$APIC_USER`/`$APIC_PASSWORD` — the same shell placeholders the `aws`,
`oauth2` and `exec` exports already use. Without it, the command runs as
printed, credentials included.

`apic curl` is [`apic snippet --lang curl`](#apic-snippet), kept for its
own `--json` shape.

## apic snippet

```
apic snippet <target> [--lang curl|httpie|powershell|python|js|go]
```

The request as code in another language, every variable resolved, for a
machine without apic, a service's README or a colleague on Windows:

| `--lang` | What it prints |
|---|---|
| `curl` (default) | The `apic curl` command |
| `httpie` | An [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/cli) command, `http --ignore-stdin …` |
| `powershell` | `Invoke-RestMethod` for PowerShell 7, with `-Headers`, `-Body` or `-Form`, `-HttpVersion`, `-SkipCertificateCheck` and `-Proxy` where they apply |
| `python` | A script using [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/): `requests.request(...)` with `headers`, `params`, `auth`, `data`/`files`, `verify`, `cert` and `proxies` |
| `js` | `fetch` for Node 18+ (an ES module) or a browser, with `FormData` for a multipart body |
| `go` | A `package main` program using `net/http`, formatted by gofmt |

Auth follows the [curl export](auth.md#curl-export): bearer, basic,
apikey and digest become what each language uses for them. The rules for
secrets are curl's too: without `--redact` the snippet runs as printed,
credentials included; with it the values are masked and the credentials
come from the environment (`TOKEN`, `APIC_USER`, `APIC_PASSWORD`,
`APIC_API_KEY`, read as `$env:TOKEN`, `os.environ["TOKEN"]`,
`process.env.TOKEN`, `os.Getenv("TOKEN")`). What a language cannot do on
its own is said in a comment at the top: AWS SigV4 signing, digest auth in
`fetch` and Go, a CA file or client certificate where the snippet cannot
point at one, a proxy for `fetch`, a required HTTP/2. A missing variable
fails with exit code 2, as for `apic curl`.

```sh
apic snippet get-user --lang python
apic snippet create-order --lang powershell --redact
apic snippet login --lang go > login.go
```

`--json` wraps it as `{"id": "get-user", "lang": "python", "code": "..."}`.
In [the UI](tui.md), <kbd>c</kbd> shows the selected request as curl and
each press moves to the next language.

## apic fmt

```
apic fmt [path|file.http#name...] [--check] [--diff]
apic fmt - < file.http
```

Rewrites request files in their canonical form, so files written by
several people (or agents) stop drifting:

- one blank line between blocks, `### Title` on its own line;
- directives in a fixed order: `name`, `description`, `disabled`, `step`,
  `auth`, `ref`, `forceRef`, `sleep`, `retry`, `timeout`, `no-redirect`, `no-session`,
  `no-cookies`, `assert`, `capture`, then unknown ones as written; comments
  keep their place among them;
- `@name = value` file variables, the request line and header names
  (`Content-Type`) with single spaces and canonical case, query
  continuations indented four spaces;
- a JSON body pretty-printed with two spaces when it parses and holds no
  `{{placeholders}}`; every other body, file bodies and editor script
  blocks kept byte for byte, only the blank lines around them dropped;
- comments travel with the directive below them when directives are
  reordered;
- trailing whitespace removed outside bodies, one final newline.

Formatting twice changes nothing. Without paths every request file of the
project is formatted; a path may be a file or a directory. `file.http#name`
(or `file.http#3`, counting `###` blocks) formats that one request and
leaves the rest of the file byte for byte, so an agent that added a request
to a file it does not own can format its own change and nothing else; a
name that is not in the file is E201. `-` reads stdin and writes the result
to stdout, which is what the VS Code extension's **Format Document** uses.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--check` | Write nothing; list the files that would change and exit 1 if there are any (a CI gate). |
| `--diff` | Write nothing; print a unified diff of what would change and exit 1 if there is any. |

`--json` prints only `{"files": N, "changed": [...], "formatted": bool}`
(plus `"diff": {file: text}` under `--diff`); nothing else goes to
stdout, so the output stays one parseable object.

## apic validate

```
apic validate [--format text|json|github|sarif]
```

Parses every `.http` file and reports errors (bad directive syntax, header
lines that are not headers, unknown selectors, missing body files,
unparsable assertions) and warnings (unknown `# @` directives, duplicate
request names). Exit code 2 when there are errors. Meant for CI and
pre-commit.

Every diagnostic points at the offending text, not just its line, and
carries a stable code:

```
users.http:12:11: error: assert "bogus == 1": unknown selector "bogus" (unknown-selector)
  # @assert bogus == 1
            ^^^^^
```

The source line and caret appear when stdout is a terminal.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-f, --format text` | The default above. |
| `-f, --format json` | Same as `--json`. |
| `-f, --format github` | GitHub Actions workflow commands (`::error file=…,line=…,col=…::…`), so a `validate` step annotates the pull request at the right place. |
| `-f, --format sarif` | SARIF 2.1.0, with one rule per code, for `github/codeql-action/upload-sarif` or any SARIF viewer. |

`--json`:

```json
{
  "ok": false, "files": 2, "requests": 5,
  "diagnostics": [
    {"path": "users.http", "line": 12, "column": 11, "end_line": 12, "end_column": 16,
     "severity": "error", "code": "unknown-selector",
     "message": "assert \"bogus == 1\": unknown selector \"bogus\""}
  ]
}
```

`line` and `column` are 1-based; `column` counts bytes from the start of
the line, and `end_column` is exclusive. The span fields and `code` are
omitted when a diagnostic has no useful span (a problem in `apic.yaml`).
They were added in 0.2; the earlier keys are unchanged.

Codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `orphan-directives` | Directives that are not followed by a request line. |
| `bad-name` | `# @name` without a value. |
| `bad-capture` | `# @capture` that is not `name = selector`. |
| `bad-assert` | `# @assert` that is not `selector op value`. |
| `bad-header` | A line in the header section that is not `Name: value`. |
| `unknown-directive` | A `# @directive` apic does not know; ignored (warning). |
| `editor-script` | An editor-only script or redirect block; skipped, not sent (warning). |
| `duplicate-name` | A request name used more than once in the project (warning). |
| `bad-auth` | An `# @auth` spec that does not parse. |
| `exec-disabled` | `# @auth exec` without `auth.allowExec` in `apic.yaml` (warning). |
| `bad-config-auth` | `auth.default` in `apic.yaml` does not parse. |
| `bad-step` | A `# @step` phrase that does not parse. |
| `ambiguous-step` | A `# @step` phrase that matches the same text as another step. |
| `bad-ref` | A `# @ref` or `# @forceRef` whose target is not exactly one request in the project. |
| `ref-cycle` | A `# @ref` chain that leads back to the request it started from. |
| `bad-retry` | A `# @retry` directive, or `retry` in `apic.yaml`, that is not `<attempts> [interval]`. |
| `bad-sleep` | A `# @sleep` whose value is not a duration such as `500ms` or `2s`. |
| `bad-http-version` | A request line whose HTTP version is not `HTTP/1.1` or `HTTP/2`. |
| `bad-auth-config` | A JetBrains `Security.Auth` configuration apic cannot use: not OAuth2, the Implicit grant, a missing Token URL or Client ID. |
| `unknown-auth-key` | A warning: a `Security.Auth` field apic does not act on. |
| `unknown-selector` | A selector that is not `status`, `statusText`, `duration`, `header.*`, `body` or `body.$*`. |
| `missing-body-file` | A `< file` body, or a `< file` part of a multipart body, whose file does not exist. |
| `bad-multipart` | A `multipart/form-data` body without a boundary, or whose parts are not laid out between `--boundary` delimiters. |
| `bad-graphql` | A GraphQL request (`GRAPHQL` method or `X-REQUEST-TYPE: GraphQL`) without a query, or whose variables block is not a JSON object. |
| `bad-save-path` | A `>> file` line with no path, a path outside the project, or a second one on the same request. |
| `missing-schema-file` | A `# @assert … matchesSchema <file>` whose schema file does not exist or lies outside the project. |

In a GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
- run: apic validate -C api --format github
```

## apic import

```
apic import <openapi.yaml|openapi.json> [-o <dir>] [--env-name <name>] [--force]
apic import <collection.postman.json> [-o <dir>] [--postman-env <file>]... [--force]
apic import --curl '<command>' [--into <file.http>] [--name <name>]
```

The format is detected from the file. From an OpenAPI 3 document it
scaffolds `.http` files:

- one file per tag (`pets.http`), operations without tags go to `api.http`;
- one request per operation named from `operationId` in kebab-case, else
  from method and path;
- `# @assert status == <first 2xx code>` (a `2XX` key becomes a range check;
  an operation that declares no 2xx response gets no status assertion);
- path parameters as `{{param}}`; required query and header parameters as
  `{{vars}}`, optional ones as commented lines;
- a JSON body built from the request schema, using examples, defaults and
  enums when present, `{{$uuid}}` and `{{$isoTimestamp}}` for uuid and
  date-time strings;
- `http-client.env.json` with `baseUrl` from the first non-empty server, with server variables replaced by their defaults.

Accepts OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 in YAML or JSON. Local `$ref` pointers
(`#/components/...`) are resolved for parameters, request bodies and
schemas; references to other files are not. Path-level parameters are
merged into each operation. Swagger 2.0 documents are rejected with a
message. Existing files are kept unless `--force` is given.

From a Postman collection (v2.1, or v2.0 where the shapes coincide; v1
exports are refused with a message):

- folders become files (`todos.http`; nested folders join with `-`,
  `todos-archive.http`), requests outside any folder go to a file named
  after the collection;
- each request becomes a named request (kebab-case of its name,
  de-duplicated with a numeric suffix) with its description;
- URL, method, headers and query map as written: Postman's `{{var}}` is
  apic's, `:id` path variables become `{{id}}` with their value as a file
  variable, `{{$guid}}` becomes `{{$uuid}}`, disabled headers and query
  parameters become comments;
- bodies: raw (with a `Content-Type` from the language when no header sets
  one), urlencoded, form-data (as a [multipart body](format.md#multipart-uploads),
  file parts pointing at a file of the same name beside the `.http` file),
  a whole-body file, and GraphQL as a JSON `{"query", "variables"}` POST;
- auth: bearer, basic, digest, awsv4 and oauth2 (client credentials and
  password grants) become `# @auth`; an API key becomes the header or
  query value; the collection's own auth becomes `auth.default` in
  `apic.yaml`; a request with "no auth" under it gets `# @auth none`;
  NTLM, Hawk and the browser OAuth2 flows are reported;
- variables: the collection's become `$shared` in `http-client.env.json`,
  and each `--postman-env` file becomes an environment named after it,
  its `secret` values going to `http-client.private.env.json` (written
  `0600`); the first environment becomes `env:` in `apic.yaml`;
- `pm.test` scripts: `pm.response.to.have.status(200)`,
  `pm.expect(jsonData.x).to.eql(...)` (also `include`, `exist`, `be.true`),
  header equality and `include`, `pm.response.to.have.header(...)`,
  `responseTime` bounds and `pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include(...)`
  become `# @assert`; `pm.environment.set("token", jsonData.token)` (and
  the `collectionVariables`, `globals` and header forms) become
  `# @capture`. Every other line, pre-request scripts included, is listed
  under `unsupported` with the request and a reason, and printed as a
  `note` line.

From a curl command (`--curl`, the reverse of `apic curl`): one `###`
block with `# @name` (from `--name`, else the method and path, so
`POST /todos` becomes `post-todos`), `# @assert status == 200`, the
headers, and the body. It reads `-X`, `-H`, `-d`/`--data`/`--data-raw`/
`--data-binary`/`--data-urlencode` (`@file` becomes `< ./file`), `-F` and
`--form-string` (a multipart body), `-u` (`# @auth basic`), `--url`,
`-G`, `-I`, `-b` (a `Cookie` header), `-A`, `-e`, `-k` (a comment: run
with `--insecure`), `-L` and `--compressed`, in both quote styles, with
`$'…'` escapes and backslash line continuations. Flags about curl's own
output or transport are ignored with a note; an unknown flag is a note,
not an error. When the project's environment has a `baseUrl` that prefixes
the URL, the host becomes `{{baseUrl}}`. Without `--into` the block is
printed; with it the block is appended to that file, relative to the
project root, created if needed, with a numeric suffix on a name the file
already has. `--curl -` reads the command from stdin.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-o, --out <dir>` | Output directory. Default `.`. |
| `--env-name <name>` | Environment name in the generated env file (OpenAPI). Default `dev`. |
| `--postman-env <file>` | A Postman environment export to import as an environment. Repeatable. |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing files. |
| `--curl <command>` | A curl command to turn into a request block; `-` reads stdin. |
| `--into <file.http>` | Append the block to this file instead of printing it. |
| `--name <name>` | The request's `# @name`. |

`--json` prints `{"files": [...], "requests": N, "base_url": "...", "env_file": "...", "skipped": [...]}`;
for a collection it adds `private_env_file` and
`unsupported: [{"request", "what", "reason"}]`. For `--curl` it prints
`{"file", "name", "request", "warnings": [...]}`.

## apic mcp

```
apic mcp [--dir <path>] [--env <name>] [--http <host:port> [--token <bearer>]]
```

Serves the project over the Model Context Protocol on stdin/stdout until
the client disconnects. Tools: `list_requests`, `describe_request`,
`run_request`, `run_file`, `run_features`, `list_environments`,
`clear_session`, `validate_project`, `curl_request`. Each `.http` file is
a resource. `--env` sets the default environment for calls that do not
pass one. See [agents.md](agents.md).

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--http <host:port>` | Serve the streamable HTTP transport on this address instead of stdio. |
| `--token <bearer>` | The bearer token clients must send. Default `$APIC_MCP_TOKEN`. Required when `--http` binds anything but the loopback interface; the server refuses to start otherwise. |

```sh
claude mcp add api -- apic mcp --dir ./api --env dev
```

## apic lsp

```
apic lsp [--dir <path>] [--env <name>]
```

A Language Server Protocol server on stdin/stdout, for Neovim, Helix,
JetBrains IDEs, Emacs or any editor with an LSP client; the set-up for
each is in [editors.md](editors.md#any-editor-with-an-lsp-client). It
publishes `apic validate`'s diagnostics for open buffers as they change
(and for `apic.yaml` and the env files when they change on disk),
completes directives, variables, selectors, operators, auth types and
`# @ref` targets, shows a variable's value and source on hover with
secrets masked, formats with `apic fmt`, and offers Run, Describe and
curl code lenses that it executes itself (`apic.lsp.run`,
`apic.lsp.describe`, `apic.lsp.curl` through `workspace/executeCommand`,
answering with what `run --json`, `describe --json` and
`curl --redact` print; the curl command lands in a notification and the
editor's log, so its credentials are shell placeholders).

The project root is found per file: inside a workspace folder, the
nearest directory holding `apic.yaml` or an `http-client` env file,
without leaving the folder, else the folder itself; outside every
folder, the file's own directory. `--dir` stands in for a client that
names no workspace. A project nested in another keeps its own
diagnostics, so two projects that each have a `login` are no clash. An
edit is checked once typing pauses (150 ms); a completion, hover or
lens for the file checks it first.

The initialisation options:

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `env` | The environment for hover, completion and runs; else `--env`, else `apic.yaml`'s `env:`. |
| `envs` | The environment per project root, `{"/path/to/api": "staging"}`, for a client that picks one per project. |
| `projectRoots` | Fixes the project root of every file in a workspace folder, `{"/path/to/folder": "/path/to/folder/api"}`, as the VS Code extension's `apic.projectDir` does. |
| `codeLens`, `formatting` | `false` leaves that feature to a client with its own, as the VS Code extension does. |

`workspace/didChangeConfiguration` with `{"apic": {"env": "staging"}}`
or `{"apic": {"envs": {"/path/to/api": "staging"}}}` changes them (an
empty value goes back to the default). The workspace is checked when the
client is ready, so problems in files that are not open show too, and
`apic.lsp.validate` (no arguments) checks it again and answers once the
diagnostics are out. A run through a code lens writes the session and
the [response history](#apic-history) as `apic run` does.

The server speaks JSON-RPC on stdout, so `--json` changes nothing for it.
It exits 0 after a `shutdown` request and an `exit` notification, and 1
when the client exits or closes the stream without one, as the protocol
asks.

## apic demo

```
apic demo [--out <dir>] [--port <port>] [--force]
```

Writes a local example project (`apic.yaml`, `http-client.env.json`,
`http-client.private.env.json`, `auth.http`, `explore.http`, `jobs.http`,
`todos.http` and `features/todos.feature`) into `--out`, then starts the
bundled fake API and serves until you stop the process. The API has login,
basic, OAuth2 client-credentials and API-key routes, a todos resource with
filtering, pagination and validation errors, jobs that finish after two
polls, a multipart upload, a GraphQL endpoint, a CSV report, a slow route
and a health check; `apic list -C apic-demo` shows the requests that use
them.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-o, --out <dir>` | Output directory for the scaffolded example project. Default `apic-demo`. |
| `--port <port>` | Localhost port to serve on and to write into `http-client.env.json`. Must be `1-65535`. Default `8089`. |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing scaffold files in `--out`. |

`--json` prints one startup object and then keeps serving:

```json
{
  "out": "apic-demo",
  "url": "http://localhost:8089",
  "written": ["apic-demo/apic.yaml"],
  "skipped": [],
  "listening": true
}
```

## apic init

```
apic init [dir] [--base-url URL] [--env NAME] [--force] [--no-skill]
```

Writes a working starting point into `dir` (default: the current
directory): `apic.yaml`, `http-client.env.json`, a `http-client.private.env.json`
with mode 0600, `api.http` with two annotated requests, a
`features/smoke.feature`, `.gitignore` lines for the private env file
and `.apic/`, and the [Agent Skill](agents.md#3-a-skill-claude-code-codex-cursor-any-agent-that-loads-skills)
under `.claude/skills/apic` and `.agents/skills/apic`, so an AI agent
working in the project knows how to use apic from the first session.
Existing files are kept unless `--force` is given, and the `.gitignore` is
appended to rather than replaced; the skill is apic's own text, so an older
copy is refreshed without `--force`.

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--base-url` | `https://api.example.com` | `baseUrl` for the environment. |
| `--env` | `dev` | Name of the first environment, also written as `env:` in `apic.yaml`. |
| `--force` | off | Overwrite files that already exist. |
| `--no-skill` | off | Do not write the Agent Skill. |

`--json` prints `{"out", "env", "written", "skipped"}`.

## apic skill

```
apic skill
apic skill install [dir] [--to <dir>]...
```

`skill` prints `SKILL.md`, the briefing an AI agent reads before working
with a project's `.http` files: the validate, list, describe, run
workflow, the `--json` shape and exit codes, the error codes to branch
on, how to write a request and where secrets belong. It is
[`skills/apic`](https://github.com/hungovercoders/apic/tree/main/skills/apic)
from the repository, compiled into the binary, so an agent that can run
commands gets the whole briefing from `apic skill` with no repository or
network. `--json` prints `{"name": "apic", "files": {"SKILL.md": …,
"references/cheatsheet.md": …}}`.

`skill install` writes the skill into `<dir>/.claude/skills/apic` (what
Claude Code reads) and `<dir>/.agents/skills/apic` (what Codex, Cursor
and the other agents that share that directory read), `dir` being the
project (`-C`) unless given. A file already holding the same text is
reported as `unchanged`; any other is overwritten, since the text is
apic's rather than the project's. Commit the result so every clone briefs
its agents. `apic init` runs the same install.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--to <dir>` | Install into this directory under the project instead of the two defaults; repeatable. `--to .claude/skills` is Claude Code only. |

`--json` prints `{"written": [...], "unchanged": [...]}`.

## apic version, apic completion

`version` prints the version, commit, Go version and platform. With
`--json`:

```json
{"version": "v1.2.3", "commit": "abc1234", "date": "2026-02-01T10:00:00Z",
 "go": "go1.25.7", "os": "linux", "arch": "amd64"}
```

`completion bash|zsh|fish|powershell` prints a shell completion script:

```sh
source <(apic completion bash)
apic completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_apic"
```

Completion knows the project: `run`, `describe` and `curl` complete request
ids and `.http` file names, and `--env` completes the environments in
`http-client.env.json`.

## Configuration file

`apic.yaml` in the project root, all keys optional:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://hungovercoders.github.io/apic/schemas/apic.schema.json
env: dev        # default --env
dir: requests   # subdirectory to scan for .http files
timeout: 30s    # default request timeout
retry: 10 2s    # default retry policy for requests without # @retry; see format.md
maxBodyBytes: 67108864  # cap on the response body read into memory (default 64 MiB)
cookies: true           # keep a cookie jar per environment in .apic/cookies.json (default off)
history: 20             # keep the last 20 responses of each request in .apic/history (default off)
proxy: http://proxy.internal:3128   # every request goes through it; --proxy beats it, --no-proxy skips it
noProxy: [localhost, .internal]     # hosts that bypass proxy: name, host:port, .suffix, IP, CIDR or *
tls:                    # a private CA and a client certificate; see auth.md
  caFile: certs/internal-ca.pem
  certFile: certs/client.pem
  keyFile: certs/client-key.pem
  hosts:
    api.internal.example.com: {certFile: certs/internal.pem, keyFile: certs/internal-key.pem}
auth:
  default: aws region=eu-west-2   # applied to requests without # @auth; see auth.md
  allowExec: false                # permit # @auth exec
test:
  paths: [features, smoke.feature] # what `apic test` runs by default
```

The first line is optional. It points the YAML language server (VS Code
with the YAML extension, JetBrains, Neovim) at the published schema, which
gives completion, descriptions and validation for every key; `apic init`
writes it for you. The schemas are generated from apic's own types, so
they cannot drift from what the binary reads:

| File | Schema |
|---|---|
| `apic.yaml` | [`schemas/apic.schema.json`](schemas/apic.schema.json) |
| `http-client.env.json`, `http-client.private.env.json` | [`schemas/http-client.env.schema.json`](schemas/http-client.env.schema.json) |
| `.apic/session.json` | [`schemas/session.schema.json`](schemas/session.schema.json) |

For the JSON files, add `"$schema"` is not part of the format the other
`.http` tools read, so associate the schema in the editor instead: in VS
Code, `json.schemas` in settings with `fileMatch: ["http-client*.env.json"]`
and the URL above.

## Files apic reads and writes

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `*.http`, `*.rest` | Request definitions. |
| `*.feature` | Gherkin specs for `apic test`. |
| `apic.yaml` | Defaults. |
| `http-client.env.json` | Public per-environment variables. |
| `http-client.private.env.json` | Secret per-environment variables. Gitignore it. |
| `.env` | `KEY=value` lines; lowest precedence after file `@vars`. |
| `.apic/session.json` | Captured values per environment. Written by `run`, cleared by `session clear`. `.apic/.gitignore` is created alongside so it is never committed. |
| `.apic/cookies.json` | The cookie jar per environment, when cookies are on. Written `0600` by `run`, cleared by `session clear`, listed by `session cookies`. |
| `.apic/history/` | The last responses of each named request per environment, when `history:` is set. One `0600` file per response, written by `run`, read by `history`, cleared by `history clear`. |
| `>> file` targets | Response bodies a request saves (`>> ./out.json`, `>>! ./out.json`) or `run --output` writes. Inside the project for `>>`; `0600` when a secret went into the request. |

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED: go run ./scripts/clidocs (task docs:cli) rewrites this section; edit the flags in internal/cli instead -->

## Commands and flags

Generated from apic's own command tree, so it lists exactly what the
binary accepts. The sections above explain each command; this is every
flag in one place. `man apic` and `man apic-run` show the same, where
the release archive's `man/` pages are installed.

### Global flags

These work with every command.

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--cacert <string>` | PEM file with certificates to trust in addition to the system roots |
| `--cert <string>` | PEM client certificate to present (mTLS) |
| `--cookies` | keep a cookie jar per environment in .apic/cookies.json (or set cookies: true in apic.yaml) |
| `-C, --dir <string>` | project root holding .http files and env files (default `.`) |
| `-e, --env <string>` | environment from http-client.env.json (default from apic.yaml) |
| `--insecure` | skip TLS certificate verification |
| `--json` | machine-readable JSON output |
| `--key <string>` | PEM private key for --cert (default: the --cert file) |
| `--no-color` | disable colour (also honours NO_COLOR) |
