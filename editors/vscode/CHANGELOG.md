# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `apic.languageServer.enable` (off by default) takes the diagnostics,
  completion and hover from `apic lsp`, the language server in apic 0.2.0
  and later, instead of the extension's own providers: problems follow the
  buffer as you type instead of appearing on save, and the same server
  serves Neovim, Helix and JetBrains. The code lenses, formatting, the
  response panel, the views and the Test Explorer are unchanged. An older
  binary leaves the extension's providers in place, with a note.

- Errors from apic read the `--json` error object on stderr (apic's error
  catalogue), and the message offers "What is E101?", which opens the
  code's entry on the docs site. Older binaries' `error:` lines still work.
- Completions: directives after `# @` with snippet bodies, variables
  inside `{{` from `apic env` and the session with built-ins and
  response references, selectors after `# @assert` and `# @capture x =`
  with the keys of the last response after `body.$.`, operators, auth
  types and request names after `# @ref`. Snippets for a request, a JSON
  request, a login-and-capture pair and the common directives.
- Hovers on `{{placeholder}}`: value, source, and for a missing one the
  request that captures it, from `apic describe`.
- Test Explorer: every `.feature` file under the project's `test.paths`
  with scenarios and example rows, run through `apic test --json` in the
  environment in effect, failing steps at their line, undefined steps
  called out, a tag expression per run or for every run, and
  `apic.test.showOutput` for apic's own pretty output. A lens above each
  `# @step` line counts the scenarios that use the phrase and opens them.

## 0.1.0

The first release. Everything runs through the apic binary's `--json`
contract; the extension never parses `.http` files itself.

- CodeLens above every request: **Run**, **Describe**, **Copy as curl**,
  and **Run file as flow** at the top of a file; `ctrl+alt+shift+r` runs
  the request under the cursor. After a run the request line shows
  `✓ 200 · 12 ms`.
- A response panel: status, headers, highlighted body with raw toggle and
  save, assertions with actual against expected, captures, errors; flows
  with a summary; a "redacted" badge; **apic: Show last response**.
- Problems from `apic validate` on activation and on every change of a
  request or config file on disk, with spans and codes, quick fixes for a
  mistyped directive, a duplicate name and a missing body file, and a
  problem count in the status bar.
- An apic view container: **Requests** (every request by file, with a
  ready/not-ready icon, Run, Describe and Copy as curl inline, a click
  opening it in the editor) and **Session** (captured values and the
  cookies in the jar for the environment in effect, with Clear session).
- The environment in the status bar, apic.yaml's own default when
  nothing is picked; **apic: Select environment** to change it.
- **Format Document** for `.http` files through `apic fmt`, so
  `editor.formatOnSave` keeps them canonical.
- Schema validation and completion for `apic.yaml` (with the YAML
  extension), `http-client.env.json`, the private file and
  `.apic/session.json`, from schemas bundled with the extension.
- Directive highlighting injected into the `http` language, binary
  discovery with a version check and install prompt, project root
  discovery, and **apic: Show version**.
