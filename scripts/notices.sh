# Generate THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md: the licence of every module compiled into apic.
#
# The module set is the union across every released platform, not just the one
# running this script: cobra pulls in mousetrap on Windows only, so a notices
# file generated on Linux alone would ship in the Windows archive incomplete.
#
# Alongside each module's licence, any NOTICE file is reproduced too (Apache
# License 2.0 section 4(d) requires it) and any PATENTS file (the additional
# grant the golang.org/x modules ship next to their BSD licence).
#
# Usage: scripts/notices.sh [output-file]
# Exits non-zero if a module has no licence file, so a release cannot ship
# notices with a hole in them.
